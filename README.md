# Supermarket webpage _2016_ES_
 A webpage made to use js, css, sql, php and html in conjunction.

 It was made in 2016.


 This webpage let's you save products in a cart and then compare prices to check where is cheaper to buy them.
 Users can create an account to save grocery lists and modify them.

 The only thing that it doesn't have is an implementation to access another webpage for supermarkets to upload their products to the database.
